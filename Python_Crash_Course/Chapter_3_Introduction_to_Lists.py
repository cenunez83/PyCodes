"""
*A list is a collection of items in a particular order.
*Square brackets indicate a list, with elements seperated by commas.

ACCESSING ELEMENTS IN A LIST

*You can access an element by telling Python the position - or index - of the item desired.
*Index positions starts at zero.
*You can use string methods (chapter 2) on any element in the list.
*Python has special code for accessing the last item of any list. Use
index -1.
*The second from last item from a list is retrieved by [-2], and the 
third to last by [-3], etc.
*You can use individual items from a list just as you would any variable.

CHANGING, ADDING, AND REMOVING ELEMENTS
*The pop() method removes the last item of a list and lets you
keep working with it. 
*You can specify the position by inputting the index in the parantheses of pop().
